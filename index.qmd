## Hi! I'm Sarah

Welcome to my website. 

A bit about me: 
I am a recent UBC Master of Data Science graduate (June 2025). I previously completed an Honours BSc in Integrated Science with a major in Mathematics and Statistics from McMaster University. 

Prior to my Masters, I worked in consulting at Isaac Operations, where I helped clients across various industries optimize their operations. 
Later, I transitioned into a senior analyst role for the same company, developing tools and dashboards to support data-driven decision-making for our clients and internally.

My passion lies in applying analytics and machine learning to drive real business outcomes. I'm motivated by creating meaningful, positive impact with my work and solving complex problems, which drives me to continue learning.

I have experience developing machine learning models, dashboards, and analytics solutions across healthcare and manufacturing sectors. I've built ML forecasting models for the BC Office of the Provincial Health Officer and led analytics projects that delivered measurable impact.
My main technical skills include Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Excel, data visualization, and end-to-end ML pipelines.

In my free time, I enjoy camping, reading, cooking, and rotating through a number of crafty hobbies (currently getting back into cross-stitch!). 

On this site you can find my [blog](blog.html) 
and some notable [projects](projects.html).
