## Hi, I'm Sarah

I have a Bachelor's of Science in Integrated Science with a major in Mathematics and Statistics from McMaster University. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of British Columbia (to be completed June 2025). My career began in consulting, where I helped clients across various industries optimize their operations. Later, I transitioned into a data analyst role, developing tools and dashboards to support data-driven decision-making in our consulting projects.

My passion lies in applying machine learning in the healthcare industry. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how data-driven approaches can enhance patient outcomes, reduce burden on healthcare professionals, and support better clinical decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy camping, reading, cooking, and rotating through a number of crafty hobbies. 

On this site you can find my [blog](blog.html) 
and some notable [projects](projects.html).
